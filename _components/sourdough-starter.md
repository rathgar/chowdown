Before you start, weigh your jar. If you have two jars then you can transfer it between them each day, otherwise you'll need the weight to do the maths. Mine for example is 1060g.

Always leave the lid loose unless you want to make a small bomb.

#### Day 1
Add all the ingredients and mix.

#### Day *n*
Take a portion of the previous day's starter and add the new quantities. Mix and rest.
