ingredients:
  - 9-10kg apples
  - 1 campden tablet
  - Yeast

directions:
  - Pulp the apples. You can do this in a big pestle with a post, a scratter, or even a blender. If using the blender you'll need a fine mesh to filter it through else there will be a lot of sediment.
  - Put the pulp in a mesh bag and squeeze out the juice.
  - Fill a gallon demijohn to the shoulder and add a crushed campden tablet. Seal with a bung and airlock and leave for 24hrs.
  - After this time if there is some sediment it's probably best to decant to a new sterile demijohn before continuing. Add the yeast and leave until the bubbling stops. It can take 12 hours to start and anything from a week to finish.
  - When finished, rack to a clean tub, add one cup of apple juice per gallon, mix and bottle. Leave for a few days before drinking.
