yield: ~12 biscuits
cookTime: PT12M

ingredients:
  - 85 g butter
  - 100 g golden castor sugar
  - 1 small egg
  - 1 tsp vanilla essence
  - 50 g raisins
  - 50 g dried cranberries
  - 50 g sunflower seeds
  - 50 g beremeal
  - ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda
  - ½ tsp salt
  - 50 g porridge oats


directions:
  - Cream together the butter and sugar until light and fluffy
  - Beat in the egg and vanilla essence
  - Stir in the remaining ingredients until combined
  - Roll into balls and place on a baking sheet. This mix should come away clean from your hands otherwise the biscuits will spread too much in the oven. Add a little more beremeal to stop this happening.
  - You can also roll the balls in oats for a rustic finish and to stop them being sticky
  - Bake in the top of the oven for 12-14 minutes at 180°C until golden.
  - Cool flat on a rack and store in an airtight container.

These biscuits carry the unique flavour of the beremeal grain which these days is only grown in the Orkney Islands.
