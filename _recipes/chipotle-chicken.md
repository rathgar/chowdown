## Chipotle Paste

Chipotles are dried, smoked jalapeño chillies. Blended with tomatoes and onions, they make a really convenient paste that can easily be stirred into dishes to add a smoky flavour and kick. Use in marinades or to flavour dips - try stirring into soured cream, starting with just a teaspoon and adding more if you need to. There are different brands to choose from - Discovery is easily available from supermarkets.

## Variations

The smoky tomato base is also great with prawns, or break in some eggs, cook until set and serve over tortillas for a version of Huevos rancheros.
