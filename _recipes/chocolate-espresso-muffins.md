yield: ~12 muffins
published: true

ingredients:
  - 1½ cups all-purpose flour
  - ½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder
  - ½ tsp baking powder
  - 1 tsp baking soda
  - ½ tsp ground cinnamon, optional
  - ¼ tsp salt
  - ½ cup granulated sugar
  - ½ cup light brown sugar (or granulated sugar)
  - 1 large egg, slightly beaten
  - ¾ cup whole milk
  - ¼ cup (60ml) strong espresso or brewed coffee, cooled
  - ½ cup (113g) butter, melted
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - ½ cup pecans or walnuts, coarsely chopped
  - ½ cup dark chocolate chips or chunks
  - 2 tbsp coarse/turbinado/demerara/brown sugar
  - 2 tbsp chopped pecans
  - 2 tbsp chocolate chips

directions:
  - Preheat oven to 190C. Butter 12 muffin cups or line them with liner papers.
  - In a large bowl, sift together flour and cocoa powder. Add baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, and sugars and mix to combine.
  - In a medium bowl, mix together egg, milk, coffee, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Pour the wet ingredients into the flour mixture and fold with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula just until combined. Do not over mix. The batter should be quite thick and lumpy. Fold in nuts and chocolate chips.
  - Divide the mixture evenly between the muffin cups. Make the topping by tossing together sugar, pecans, and chocolate chips in a small bowl, then sprinkle evenly on top of the batter. Bake for 15-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the muffins comes out clean. Transfer pan to a wire rack and let cool for 10 minutes, then remove muffins from pan and let cool completely.
  - Muffins will keep for 2 days in an airtight container at room temperature. They can also be frozen for up to 2 months. To thaw, leave them on the counter, still covered, or overnight in the fridge.

I also drizzled a syrup over the top once they are on the cooling rack. This is made with molasses and *very* strong coffee.
