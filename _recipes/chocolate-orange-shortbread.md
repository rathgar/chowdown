published: true

ingredients:
  - 150g unsalted butter, at room temperature
  - 200g plain flour
  - 50g golden caster sugar, plus extra to sprinkle
  - 1 orange
  - 50g quality dark chocolate
  - 50g candied orange peel (chopped)
  - 2tsp allspice
  - 50g chopped stem ginger

directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 190ºC
  - Grease a 20cm square baking tin and line with greaseproof paper.
  - In a bowl, mix together the butter, flour, sugar, allspice and the finely grated zest of half the orange by rubbing the mixture between your thumbs and fingertips.
  - Mix in the ginger and candied peel.
  - Squash and pat into dough – don’t knead it – then push into the lined tin in a 1cm-thick layer. Prick all over with a fork, then bake for 20 minutes, or until lightly golden.
  - Remove, sprinkle over a little extra sugar while it’s still warm, then leave to cool.
  - Meanwhile, melt the chocolate in a heatproof bowl over a pan of gently simmering water, then remove.
  - Cut the shortbread into 12 finger portions, then transfer to a wire cooling rack.
  - Drizzle with the chocolate, then finely grate over the remaining orange zest. Cut up the orange, and serve on the side!
