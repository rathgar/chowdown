ingredients:
  - Tatties, skin on
  - Neeps (swede)
  - Couple of carrots (optional)
  - Seasoning
  - Nutmeg
  - Splash of milk (can be non-dairy)
  - Knob of butter (optional)

directions:
  - Cut up the veg and boil them separately until cooked.
  - Mash the potatoes to a creamy consistency add the slightly less mashed neeps and the carrots fairly well beaten up. The carrots should be half mashed with a few tiny spots of orange to add interest to the clapshot. Season to taste.

If you're freezing this, make lots. Allow to come to room to just above temperature - it's nicer to handle - and form into balls by grabbing a handful (about a one person portion) and patting it into a spheroid
