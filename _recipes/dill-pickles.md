ingredients:
  - 1kg small pickling or ridged cucumber
  - 85g coarse crystal sea salt
  - 1 tbsp black peppercorns
  - 1 tbsp coriander seeds
  - 1 tbsp yellow mustard seeds
  - 10 cloves
  - few pieces of mace blades
  - pinch of dried chilli flakes (optional)
  - 2 bay leaves
  - 700ml white wine vinegar, plus 3.5 tbsp
  - 100g white sugar
  - handful of dill sprigs

directions:
  - Cut the pickling or ridged cucumbers into sticks or slices. Layer with the coarse crystal sea salt in a large bowl, cover and leave overnight. Drain away the brine, then rinse.
  - Toast the spices over a low heat until they begin to smell aromatic. Add the dried chilli flakes last, as these can easily catch. Add the bay, pour in all of the vinegar and sugar, let it dissolve, and bring to a simmer. Add the dill sprigs.
  - Pack the cucumber into jars, pour over the hot vinegar and seal. Ready to eat in 2 weeks, or longer, if you like.
