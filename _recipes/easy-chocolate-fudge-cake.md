ingredients:
  - 150ml sunflower oil, plus extra for the tin
  - 175g self-raising flour
  - 2 tbsp cocoa powder
  - 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
  - 150g caster sugar
  - 2 tbsp golden syrup
  - 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
  - 150ml semi-skimmed milk
  - For the icing
  - 100g unsalted butter
  - 225g icing sugar
  - 40g cocoa powder
  - 2½ tbsp milk (a little more if needed)


directions:
  - Heat the oven to 160°C. Oil and line the base of two 18cm sandwich tins. Sieve the flour, cocoa powder and bicarbonate of soda into a bowl. Add the caster sugar and mix well.
  - Make a well in the centre and add the golden syrup, eggs, sunflower oil and milk. Beat well with an electric whisk until smooth.
  - Pour the mixture into the two tins and bake for 25-30 mins until risen and firm to the touch. Remove from oven, leave to cool for 10 mins before turning out onto a cooling rack.
  - To make the icing, beat the unsalted butter in a bowl until soft. Gradually sieve and beat in the icing sugar and cocoa powder, then add enough of the milk to make the icing fluffy and spreadable.
  - Sandwich the two cakes together with the butter icing and cover the sides and the top of the cake with more icing.
