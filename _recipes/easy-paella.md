ingredients:
  - 1 tbsp olive oil
  - 1 onion, chopped
  - 1 tsp each hot smoked paprika and dried thyme
  - 300g paella or risotto rice
  - 3 tbsp dry sherry or white wine (optional)
  - 400g can chopped tomatoes with garlic
  - 900ml chicken stock
  - 400g frozen seafood mix , defrosted
  - 1 lemon, ½ juiced, ½ cut into wedges
  - handful of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped

directions:
  - Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan or wok. Add the onion and soften for 5 mins.
  - Add the smoked paprika, thyme and paella rice, stir for 1 min, then splash in the sherry, if using. Once evaporated, stir in the chopped tomatoes and chicken stock.
  - Season and cook, uncovered, for about 15 mins, stirring now and again until the rice is almost tender and still surrounded with some liquid.
