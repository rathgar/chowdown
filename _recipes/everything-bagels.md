ingredients:
  - 1 tbs sugar
  - 2 tsp salt
  - 2 tsp quick yeast
  - 2 cups wholewheat flour
  - 1½ cups white flour
  - 2 tsp dried, minced onion
  - Pinch of garlic powder
  - ¼ tsp dried thyme
  - ¼ tsp dried sage
  - 2 tbs mixed seeds
  - 1½ cups warm water
  - ¼ cup olive oil
  - Seeds for topping

directions:
  - Combine 1½ cups warm water, the sugar and kosher salt in the bowl of a stand mixer and sprinkle the yeast on top. Set aside for 5 minutes, or until the mixture foams.
  - Add the flour and olive oil and mix on low speed with the dough hook attachment until well combined. Change to medium speed and knead until the dough is smooth and pulls away from the side of the bowl, 4 to 5 minutes.
  - Add in the mixed seeds, dried onion, garlic powder, dried thyme, and dried sage. Knead for 30 seconds to 1 minute longer, or until herbs are incorporated.
  - Remove the dough from the bowl and oil it lightly with olive oil. Return the dough to the bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and set aside in a warm place for 1 hour, or until the dough has doubled in size.
  - Once dough has risen, turn dough out onto a floured work surface.
  - Divide dough into 8 equal pieces, dividing the dough in half, then halving each half twice, creating 8 pieces total.
  - Roll each dough piece into a 10-inch long rope, rolling the dough with your hands outward until rope has formed.
  - After dough has been rolled out into a rope, squish down one end of the rope and form into a bagel (circle) shape, pushing the squished end into the side of the bagel. Repeat the rolling and forming process until all bagels have been formed.
  - Place formed bagels on a greased, rimmed baking sheet. Cover lightly with a kitchen towel and allow to rise for 15-20 minutes, until bagels are puffy and slightly risen.
  - After the bagels have risen, heat the oven to 220ºC. Line 2 half sheet pans with parchment paper and lightly brush with oil. Set aside.
  - Bring water to a boil in a large pot.
  - Three at a time, place the bagels in the boiling water for 30 seconds. Remove them from the water using a large flat spatula and return them to the sheet pans, brush the top of each bagel with a little more olive oil and sprinkle with extra seeds.
  - Bake until dark golden brown in color, 20-25 minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack for at least 5 minutes before serving. Best served within the first day of baking.
