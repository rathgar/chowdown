ingredients:
  - 50g salted butter
  - 50g light muscovado sugar
  - 50g golden syrup
  - 50g plain flour
  - 50g glacé cherries, chopped
  - 75g flaked almonds
  - 50g pistachios, chopped
  - 2 oranges, zested
  - 175g dark chocolate

directions:
  - Heat oven to 180°C. Line two baking sheets with baking parchment. Melt the butter, sugar and golden syrup in a small saucepan over a low heat, stirring frequently. Remove from the heat and whisk in the flour then add the cherries, flaked almonds, pistachios and orange zest.
  - Scoop 10 flat tbsp of the mixture onto the baking sheets, leaving room for them to spread. You will need to do these in batches. Bake for 10 mins until golden. Leave to cool for 2 mins until firm enough to lift onto a wire rack. Cool completely. Repeat with the remaining mixture.
  - Melt the chocolate in a bowl over a simmering saucepan of water or in the microwave in 30 second bursts. Turn the florentines over on the wire rack. Spoon chocolate onto the base of each florentine and gently spread to the edges. When the chocolate is firm enough to hold its shape, use a fork to draw wavy lines across the chocolate. Leave to set and then store in an airtight container.
