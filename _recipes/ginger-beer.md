yield:

ingredients:
  - 4L water
  - 400g ginger
  - 500g sugar
  - 3 star anise
  - 30 black peppercorns
  - 12 allspice berries
  - 12 cardamom pods
  - 3 cloves
  - 200ml ginger bug

directions:
  - Blend the ginger with a bit of the water from the recipe.
  - Pour the ginger and all of the water along with the sugar and spices into a heavy pot and bring to a simmer.
  - Simmer for at least 10 minutes, but up to 30 minutes is great, stirring to dissolve the sugar.
  - Turn off the heat, cover and allow to cool to room temp or overnight.
  - Strain out the solids through a (cheesecloth lined) fine mesh strainer.
  - Mix in the ginger bug.
  - Pour into sealable bottles or jugs that are 'pressure rated' - beer or pop bottles are great.
  - Let stand on your countertop at room temp (21ºC - 23ºC) for 1-3 days, depending on the level of carbonation and alcohol you are looking for.
  - Refrigerate and enjoy!
