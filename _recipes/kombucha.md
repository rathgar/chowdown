# Fermentation Process

## Brewing the Tea

For 1 litre kombucha scoby: Add 900ml of non-chlorinated water to your saucepan and add 60g of sugar.
For 2 litre kombucha scoby: Add 1800ml of non-chlorinated water to your saucepan and add 120g of sugar.
For 3 litre kombucha scoby: Add 2700ml of non-chlorinated water to your saucepan and add 180g of sugar.
For 5 litre kombucha scoby: Add 4500ml of non-chlorinated water to your saucepan and add 300g of sugar.

Stir the mixture and then begin to heat the water. You do not need to bring the water to boiling point. Doing so can ruin the flavour of your kombucha. Ideally, you want the mixture to be between 65 to 80 Celsius. You can use a thermometer to check the temperature. However, just bringing the water to the stage just before it boils is adequate.  If it does boil, simply allow it to cool back down for 10 minutes. Ensure you stir the mixture regularly as the water heats up so the sugar dissolves.

For 1 litre kombucha scoby: Add 10g of tea (2 teabags) to the water.
For 2 litre kombucha scoby: Add 20g of tea (4 teabags) to the water.
For 3 litre kombucha scoby: Add 30g of tea (6 teabags) to the water.
For 5 litre kombucha scoby: Add 50g of tea (10 teabags) to the water.

Allow the tea too steep for around 15 minutes. If you have used loose tea, you will now need to strain out any tea leaves that may be left in the mixture. It is important to do this as any remaining tea leaves may go mouldy and can contaminate your kombucha. Donâ€™t over steep your tea as this will lead to a bitter taste.

Next, allow your mixture cool back down to room temperature (21 Celsius). This is very important, never place your kombucha scoby into the warm/hot water, this can damage it.

## The First Fermentation

Pour your cooled mixture into your fermentation jar. Add the starter tea. It is important to add starter tea to each batch of kombucha you brew. This helps reduce the risk of contamination from pathogens, and other unwanted bacteria by ensuring established kombucha bacteria is the first to arrive into the mixture.

Add your kombucha scoby, cover the jar and leave it at room temperature (21 Celsius) for 5-12 days. At around 5 days the kombucha will still be fairly sweet, at 12 it will have become more tart. This is a taste preference that you will acquire in your time making kombucha. Personally, we prefer our kombucha at around the 5-day mark.

The temperature will play a large part in the brewing process. During the warm summer months, a much shorter time is required to make kombucha. During the winter it will take much longer.

Never leave any fermenting product in direct sunlight. This can lead to unwanted bacteria and pathogens forming.

Remove the kombucha scoby from the jar, remembering to take 10% of the kombucha to use as the starter tea for your next batch. It is always best to take the starter tea from the top of the kombucha mixture, as this contains the most bacteria.

## Bottling the kombucha

Using your plastic funnel, pour the remaining kombucha liquid into your glass bottles and then seal them by closing the lids. You can at this stage choose to add additional flavourings to your kombucha. This is optional, but many find experimenting with different types of fruit great addition to making kombucha tea. We like to use fresh ginger ourselves. Experiment with different flavours, Google has many recipes online.

Leaving the bottled kombucha at room temperature (21 Celsius) for another 3-5 days will allow the kombucha to carbonate. This is optional, and you can drink you kombucha right away.

Place your bottles in the fridge and allow them to cool. Be very careful when opening the bottles.  Kombucha can produce an extremely fizzy beverage that is prone to exploding out the bottle.

During the colder winter months it can take longer to carbonate. Anything from 7-14 days.
