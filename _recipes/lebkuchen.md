yield: 35 lebkuchen
preptime: PT20M
cooktime: PT25M
components: [Lebkuchengewürz]

ingredients:
  - 5 large eggs
  - 1¼ cup packed brown sugar
  - ¼ cup honey
  - 1 tsp quality pure vanilla extract
  - 2 cups almond meal
  - 2 cups hazelnut meal
  - ¼ tsp salt
  - ½ tsp baking powder
  - 3 tsp Lebkuchengewürz
  - 4 oz candied lemon peel
  - 4 oz candied orange peel
  - ¼ cup all-purpose flour (to coat the candied peel) (can substitute gluten free)
  - Backoblaten either 70mm or 90mm
  - Blanched whole almonds cut in half lengthwise

directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 150°C.
  - Toss the candied lemon and orange peel with about ¼ cup all-purpose flour to keep it from sticking together and then pulse in a food processor until finely minced. Set aside.
  - In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs until foamy. Add the sugar, honey and vanilla extract and beat until combined.
  - Add the ground almonds and hazelnuts, salt, baking powder, Lebkuchengewürz, and candied lemon and orange peels and stir vigorously until thoroughly combined. (You can use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and beat for about 2 minutes). The mixture will be wet but if it is too thin to scoop onto the oblaten add some more almond or hazelnut meal.
  - Scoop the mixture onto the Backoblaten, smoothing down the top and leaving just a slight space around the edges. Set them on a lined cookie sheet.
  - Bake on the middle rack of the oven for 25-28 minutes. Remove the cookie sheet and allow to cool completely.
  - Once cooled, place a wire rack over a cookie sheet (to catch the drippings). Dip half the Lebkuchen in the chocolate glaze and half in the sugar glaze, letting the excess drip back into the bowl and then place the Lebkuchen on the wire rack. Arrange 3 almonds on each Lebkuchen while the glaze is still wet. Let the Lebkuchen dry completely until the glaze is hardened.
  - Keep stored in an airtight container.  Will keep for several weeks and the flavor improves with time.
  - Makes about 35 if using 70mm Backoblaten and about 25 if using 90mm Backoblaten.
