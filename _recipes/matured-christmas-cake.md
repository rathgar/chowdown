ingredients:
  - 1kg mixed dried fruit (use a mix of raisins, sultanas, currants, cherries, cranberries, prunes or figs)
  - 1 orange - zest and juice
  - 1 lemon - zest and juice
  - 150 ml brandy, sherry, whisky or rum, plus extra for feeding
  - 250 g butter, softened
  - 200 g light soft brown sugar

  - 175 g plain flour
  - 100 g ground almond
  - ½ tsp baking powder
  - 2 tsp mixed spice
  - 1 tsp ground cinnamon
  - ¼ tsp ground cloves
  - 100 g flaked almond
  - 4 large eggs
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract

directions:
  - Put 1kg mixed dried fruit, the zest and juice of 1 orange and 1 lemon, 150ml brandy or other alcohol, 250g softened butter and 200g light, soft brown sugar in a large pan set over a medium heat.
  - Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 5 mins. Tip the fruit mixture into a large bowl and leave to cool for 30 mins.
  - Heat oven to 150°C/130°C fan. Line a deep 20cm cake tin with a double layer of baking parchment, then wrap a double layer of newspaper around the outside – tie with string to secure.
  - Add 175g plain flour, 100g ground almonds, ½ tsp baking powder, 2 tsp mixed spice, 1 tsp ground cinnamon, ¼ tsp ground cloves, 100g flaked almonds, 4 large eggs and 1 tsp vanilla extract to the fruit mixture and stir well, making sure there are no pockets of flour.
  - Tip into your prepared tin, level the top with a spatula and bake in the centre of the oven for 2 hrs.
  - Remove the cake from the oven, poke holes in it with a skewer and spoon over 2 tbsp of your chosen alcohol. Leave the cake to cool completely in the tin.
  - To store, peel off the baking parchment, then wrap well in cling film. Feed the cake with 1-2 tbsp alcohol every fortnight, until you ice it.
  - Don’t feed the cake for the final week to give the surface a chance to dry before icing.

Bake this festive fruit cake in advance of Christmas and feed it regularly with rum, brandy or whisky to build the flavour and keep it moist. Start around the beginning of October to give plenty of time for feeding, it gets better with age.
