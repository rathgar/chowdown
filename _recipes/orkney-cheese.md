ingredients:
  - 3 lt whole milk
  - ¼ cup white vinegar
  - 1½ tsp salt

directions:
  - Heat the milk in a pot until just before it boils, turn off the heat.
  - Add a quarter cup of white vinegar. The milk should immediately separate into curds and whey. If it does not separate, add a bit more vinegar one tablespoon at a time, until you see the milk solids coagulate into curds swimming within the whey.
  - Filter through a fine colander or cheesecloth. Wash with cold water.
  - Add the salt and mix. Wring out as much water as you can then hang to drip.
  - Best served chilled.
