ingredients:
  - 1 tbsp of oil
  - 1/2 onion, finely diced
  - 2 garlic cloves, minced
  - 1 tbsp of tomato purée
  - 1/2 tsp smoked paprika
  - 1/4 tsp dried thyme
  - 1 tsp of brown sugar
  - 1 tbsp of soy sauce
  - 400g of tinned cannellini beans, drained (240g when drained)
  - 100g of passata
  - black pepper

directions:
  - Heat the oil in a saucepan, and add the onion and garlic. Cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes until soft and translucent. Add the tomato purée, paprika, thyme, brown sugar and soy sauce, and cook for a couple more minutes
  - Add the beans and passata, and simmer for at least 5 minutes, until the mixture is piping hot and the sauce has thickened a little
  - Season generously with black pepper - you probably won't need salt because of the soy sauce, but add it if you think it needs it. Serve warm on toast
