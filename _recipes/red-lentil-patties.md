ingredients:
  - 3/4 cup (150 g) red lentils dry
  - 1 cup (240-300 ml) vegetable broth or water
  - 1 small (90 g) red pepper diced
  - 1 small/medium (90 g) onion diced
  - 2 large cloves of garlic chopped
  - 4 tbsp (30 g) chickpea flour more if needed
  - 1 tbsp ground chia seeds
  - 3 tbsp fresh parsley chopped
  - 1 tsp paprika powder
  - 3/4 tsp ground cumin
  - 1/2 tsp onion powder
  - 1/2 tsp salt
  - Pepper and red pepper flakes to taste
  - Oil for frying

directions:
  - Rinse the red lentils in a sieve under running water to remove any debris. Transfer them to a pot or pan along with 1 cup of vegetable broth. If using water, add a little salt. Bring to a boil and let the lentils simmer for about 15 minutes, or until they are soft and partially falling apart. There shouldn't be any broth or water left after cooking.
  - Meanwhile, heat a little oil in a skillet and add the onion, pepper, and garlic. Fry over medium heat for a few minutes, until the onion is translucent (not browned).
  - Once the lentils are cooked, add them to a food processor together with the cooked veggies, spices, parsley, ground chia seeds, and flour. Pulse a couple of times until the mixture is combined. You want to leave some texture, so do not over-process it.
  - The mixture should be shapeable, if it's not, add a little more flour.
  - Form 10 patties (each weighing between 40-50 grams - about 2 1/2 - 3 tablespoons), and fry them with a little oil (I used 2 teaspoons for 4 patties) in a skillet from both sides (about 3 minutes each side) until golden brown and crispy.
  - Serve with a dip of choice, and enjoy! I made a dip from 2 tablespoons of creamy peanut butter mixed with 30 ml dill pickle juice, 10 ml olive brine, a little garlic, and smoked paprika to taste.
