ingredients:
  - 1 tightly packed white or green cabbage (approximately 900g), shredded, washed and well-drained
  - 1 tbsp flaked/fine sea salt
  - 2 tsp black peppercorns
  - ½ tsp caraway seeds (optional)

directions:
  - Wash equipment thoroughly in hot soapy water. Leave to air dry.
  - Put the cabbage in a clean mixing bowl and add the flaked salt. Massage the salt into the cabbage with clean hands for 8–10 minutes, or until the cabbage is limp and watery. There should be a pool of liquid left in the bowl. Reserve this to cover the cabbage in the jar.
  - Toss the cabbage with the black peppercorns and caraway seeds (if using). Transfer the cabbage and the reserved liquid to the prepared jar, leaving a large gap at the top, and press down well with the prepared small ladle or spoon.
  - Place a ramekin or clean jar on top of the cabbage and fill with filtered water or baking beans to weigh it down and keep the cabbage just under the liquid. Cover with the lid and fasten tightly.
  - Leave the cabbage to ferment in a cool place (not the fridge), out of direct sunlight, for 4–7 days. The sourness comes from the lactic acid produced during the fermentation process. If the sauerkraut is fermented at too high a temperature it can inhibit the process. Loosen, then tighten, the lid briefly each day to allow any gas to escape that has collected as the result of the fermentation process.
  - Taste the sauerkraut after 4 days and, if the flavour is as you like it, you can slow the fermentation dramatically by chilling. Alternatively, leave longer to develop the flavour more fully. The sauerkraut should be tangy with a slightly salty cabbage flavour and will become crunchier.
