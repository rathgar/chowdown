ingredients:
  - 140 g rolled oats or porridge oats
  - 140 g fine oatmeal (or rolled oats in a blender)
  - 140 g mixed seeds (flax, chia, sunflower, sesame, pumpkin)
  - ¾ tsp salt
  - ¼ tsp black pepper
  - 60 ml olive oil
  - 15 ml sesame seed oil
  - 100-150 ml boiling water
  - wholemeal flour (for rolling out)

directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 180C/160C Fan/Gas 4.
  - Line 2 baking trays with baking parchment or greaseproof paper.
  - In a bowl, stir together the oats, oatmeal, seeds, salt, and pepper.
  - Make a well in the centre then pour in the oil plus 100ml of boiling water.
  - Stir quickly to bring the mixture together into a firm dough, adding more boiling water as needed.
  - Lightly dust your worksurface with wholemeal flour (or oatmeal) and transfer the dough onto it.
  - Sprinkle the dough and a rolling pin with a little more wholemeal flour or oatmeal and roll out the dough 3-5 mm thick.
  - If the dough starts to come apart at the edges, just push it back together with your hands.
  - Cut out oatcakes using a 6 cm cutter then transfer to the baking trays.
  - Bring together the scraps and re-roll to make more oatcakes until all the dough is used up. You may need to add a little more water when bringing together the scraps.
  - Put the trays in the preheated oven and bake until the oatcakes are golden brown and cooked all the way through. Unless you've rolled the dough very thickly or thinly, they should take approximately 30 minutes.

Easy, wholesome oatcakes made better with seeds. Good with cheese, pâté, nut butters, soup, on their own as a nutritious snack, or especially good with single malt whisky.
