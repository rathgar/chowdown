totaltime: PT2H50M

ingredients:
  - 400g strong wholemeal bread flour
  - 100g spelt flour
  - 2 tsp fast-action dried yeast
  - 1 tsp salt
  - 250 ml warm water
  - 1 tbsp black treacle or honey
  - oil, for greasing
  - 50g mixed seeds (eg sesame, pumpkin, sunflower, poppy and linseeds)

directions:
  - Combine flours with the yeast and salt. Mix the treacle/honey with 250ml warm water until well combined. Stir into the flour to make a slightly sticky dough. If you need to add more water, splash it in 1 tbsp at a time.
  - Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 10 mins (or a mixer for 5-7 mins). Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, flip the dough over to coat it in oil, then cover with a sheet of oiled cling film. Leave in a warm place until doubled in size – about 1 hr.
  - Once doubled in size, knead the dough again for 3-5 mins to knock out the air bubbles – add the seeds and work these into the dough as you knead. Shape the dough into a ball and give structure. Leave to prove, covered, for 30-45 mins until it has nearly doubled in size again. Heat oven to 200°C (fan).
  - When it’s ready, bake in the oven for 40-45 mins until golden brown. Leave to cool on a wire rack for at least 30 mins before slicing.
