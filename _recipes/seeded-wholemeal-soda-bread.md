yield: 1 loaf (10 slices)

components:
  - Buttermilk (yoghurt)
  - Buttermilk (milk)

ingredients:
  - 400ml Buttermilk
  - 450g wholemeal flour, plus extra for dusting
  - 75g seed mix
  - 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda
  - 1 tbsp black treacle
  - 450 ml buttermilk

directions:
  - Heat oven to 200°C/180°C fan
  - line a baking sheet with baking parchment.
  - Put the flour, seeds, bicarbonate of soda and a pinch of salt in a large bowl and mix to combine.
  - Stir the treacle into the yogurt mixture
  - when the treacle dissolves, pour onto the dry ingredients. Stir together with the blade of a knife until you have a soft, sticky dough.
  - Leave for 5 mins (this allows time for the liquid to absorb into the bran)
  - Tip onto a lightly floured surface and form the dough into a round about 18cm across. It will still be very sticky, so don’t over-handle it – treat it like scone dough rather than bread dough.
  - Lift onto the baking sheet and bake for 25-30 mins until the crust is golden and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath.
