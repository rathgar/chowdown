ingredients:
  - 4 tbsp nutritional yeast
  - 2 tbsp dried basil
  - 3 tsp onion powder
  - 2 tsp garlic powder
  - 1 tsp black pepper
  - 1 cup walnuts
  - 2½ cup vital wheat gluten
  - 2 cup cooked lentils
  - ½ cup sun-dried tomatoes (in oil)
  - 2 tbsp soy sauce
  - 2 tbsp worcester sauce
  - 12 tbsp water

directions:
  - Add all the dry ingredients (except the seitan) to a food processor and pulse until you reach a crumb.
  - Add everything else and kneed to a smooth dough by hand or in a mixer.
  - Pinch off some of the dough and massage into a pattie. Set aside. Repeat until all the dough is used up.
  - Steam the patties for 25 minutes, gently turning them halfway through. They will expand a bit when they steam. Once the steaming is done, you can either prepare them right away, or allow them to cool completely and store in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to 5 days, or freeze for later.
  - Pan fry or barbecue them to give them some colour and serve with your favourite sauce.
