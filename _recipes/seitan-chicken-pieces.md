ingredients:
  - __Chicken__
  - 439 g pack of silken tofu
  - 400 g tin of cannellini beans (including the soaking water)
  - 6 tbsp vegetable oil (sunflower, rapeseed, canola will do)
  - 2 tsp flaky sea salt
  - 2 tbsp white miso paste
  - 2 teaspoon rice vinegar (apple cider vinegar or white wine vinegar)
  - 380 g vital wheat gluten
  - 1 teaspoon garlic powder
  - __Brine__
  - 3 cloves garlic (crushed)
  - 4 tbsp white miso paste
  - 120 ml dry white wine
  - 500 ml just boiled water
  - 2 tbsp mushroom bouillon (or 2 mushroom stock cubes)
  - 2 tsp flaky sea salt
  - 4 bay leaves

directions:
  - __Chicken__
  - Place the tofu, cannellini beans (and their water), 3 tablespoon of the vegetable oil, sea salt, miso paste and rice vinegar into the largest cup or jug attachment of a high speed blender. Blend on high speed for a minimum of 1 minute. Remove the cup, shake it well or use a spatula to make sure no chunks are stuck to the side then blend again for another 30 seconds until very smooth and creamy.
  - Add the vital wheat gluten, garlic powder, and the mixture to a bread machine and kneed for about 5-10mins until fully mixed. Near then end add the remaining three tablespoons of vegetable oil and mix.
  - Divide the seitan chicken dough into 8 pieces, roughly 150g each. Working with one at a time, pinch the edges of the piece of seitan and tuck it over and into the centre, making one smooth side and one folded, tucked side. Roughly shape the dough into a fillet. Repeat with the remaining pieces.
  - Place the seitan fillets on small pieces of greaseproof paper or parchment onto the rack in the Foodi and steam at high for 20mins with natural release.
  - Once cooked, remove the seitan chicken from the steamer and leave to cool for at least 20 minutes. While the chicken cools, prepare the marinade.
  - __Brine__
  - Put the crushed garlic, miso paste, dry white wine and sugar in a medium bowl and whisk together until a smooth paste forms. Set aside.
  - Once your vegan chicken is cooled, pull apart each piece into two (don't slice with a knife as the torn, meaty texture helps the chicken to soak up flavour).
  - Place the vegan chicken into a large tupperware container with a lid or a large deep baking tin. Pour over the miso/wine mixture and use your hands to rub the marinade into the vegan chicken.
  - Add the just boiled water to a large measuring jug and add the remaining brine ingredients. Pour over the chicken pieces while the brine is still hot and use a fork to make sure all the chicken is covered in liquid. Cover with reusable wrap or a lid and allow the brine to cool to room temperature on the counter. Once cooled, place in the fridge and leave to marinate for a minimum of 8 hours, ideally 12 if you can.
  - Once the chicken has marinated for a minimum of 8 hours, it is ready to use.
  - For shredded chicken, use a fork to pull apart the marinated vegan chicken into fine shreds. For chunks either pull the vegan chicken apart by hand for a rough texture or slice into pieces with a knife.
