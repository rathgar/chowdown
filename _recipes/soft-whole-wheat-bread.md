ingredients:
  - ¾ cup milk
  - 2 tbsp molasses (or brown sugar)
  - 2 tsp salt
  - 2 tbsp butter
  - 1 ½ cups warm water
  - 3 cups whole wheat flour
  - 2 cups all purpose flour
  - 2 tsp instant yeast

directions:
  - Heat the milk in the microwave until it is steaming.
  - Stir in the molasses, salt, and butter. Continue stirring until the butter is melted.
  - Transfer the milk mixture to a bowl and add the water, flours, and yeast.
  - Mix with a wooden spoon until everything comes together.
  - If it is too wet and sticky to clear the bottom of the bowl, add a little more flour, a couple tablespoons at a time, until the dough clears the bottom of the bowl. It should be soft and slightly tacky to the touch, but not overly sticky. If the dough is really dry and the flour is not completely mixing in, add a bit more water, a tablespoon at a time, until the dough comes together into a smooth ball.
  - Knead the dough 10-12 mins until it is smooth and elastic.
  - Move the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, turning it to coat, and cover.
  - Allow it to rise until doubled, about 60-90 minutes.
  - Punch down the dough and turn it out onto a lightly oiled surface.
  - Divide it into two pieces and shape each piece into a loaf.
  - Place each loaf into an oiled 8x4 inch bread pan and cover lightly with plastic wrap (make sure the ends aren’t trapped, you don’t want it to stop the bread from rising).
  - Allow the loaves to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until they have almost doubled.
  - Preheat the oven to 200°C.
  - Bake the loaves for 28-32 minutes, until golden brown.
  - Turn the loaves out onto a wire rack immediately, rub the tops of the loaves with butter if desired (this makes the crust a bit softer), and cool completely before slicing.
