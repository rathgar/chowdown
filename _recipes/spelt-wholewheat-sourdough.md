# Levain
- 25g Mature starter
- 65g Flour whole/plain or mixed
- 65g Water ~25°C

# Dough
- 650g Whole Wheat Flour
- 575g Water ~25°C
- 140g (all) yesterday's levain

# Stretches & folds
## First set
Pull the dough up stretching it as far as it will go without breaking and fold it over the top down to the other side. Do this eight times around the perimeter.

On the fourth time flip the dough over before returning to warm place.

## Second set (coil folds)
Lift the dough up allowing it to stretch down and fold it under itself. These are gentler and allow any air to remain in the dough. Do this twice each time at 90 degrees.
