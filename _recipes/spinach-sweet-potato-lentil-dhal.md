ingredients:
  - 1 tbsp sesame oil
  - 1 red onion, finely chopped
  - 1 garlic clove, crushed
  - thumb-sized piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped
  - 1 red chilli, finely chopped
  - 1½ tsp ground turmeric
  - 1½ tsp ground cumin
  - 2 sweet potatoes (about 400g/14oz), cut into even chunks
  - 250g red split lentils
  - 600ml vegetable stock
  - 80g bag of spinach or frozen blocks
  - 4 spring onions, sliced on the diagonal, to serve


directions:
  - Heat 1 tbsp sesame oil in a wide-based pan with a tight-fitting lid.
  - Add 1 finely chopped red onion and cook over a low heat for 10 mins, stirring occasionally, until softened.
  - Add 1 crushed garlic clove, a finely chopped thumb-sized piece of ginger and 1 finely chopped red chilli, cook for 1 min, then add 1½ tsp ground turmeric and 1½ tsp ground cumin and cook for 1 min more.
  - Turn up the heat to medium, add 2 sweet potatoes, cut into even chunks, and stir everything together so the potato is coated in the spice mixture.
  - Tip in 250g red split lentils, 600ml vegetable stock and some seasoning.
  - Bring the liquid to the boil, then reduce the heat, cover and cook for 20 mins until the lentils are tender and the potato is just holding its shape.
