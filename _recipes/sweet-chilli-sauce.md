preptime: PT10M
cooktime: PT25M

ingredients:
  - 20 red chillies, stems removed, deseeded for a milder sauce
  - 1 finger sized piece of ginger, peeled and roughly chopped
  - 5 garlic cloves, roughly chopped
  - 100 ml white wine or cider vinegar
  - 200 g white caster sugar


directions:
  - Tip all the ingredients except the sugar into a mini chopper or blender and blend to a chunky sauce. Scrape the contents into a shallow saucepan with the sugar and 100ml water and bring to a simmer.
  - Simmer for 15 mins, stirring occasionally until it becomes syrupy. Keeping a close eye on it, continue to simmer and stir for 5 mins more until it easily coats the back of the spoon and you see the bottom of the pan when you stir. Leave to cool and infuse for 1-2 hours. Will keep in a small sterilised jar for up to a month.

I also made this with dried chillies - mostly chipotle - which was incredible.
