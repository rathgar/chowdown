ingredients:
  - 4 medium sweet potatoes
  - 1 large bunch coriander, stalks finely chopped, leaves picked and roughly torn
  - 2 tbsp olive oil
  - 50g chipotle spice paste, plus extra to taste
  - 2 (400g) tins black beans, drained
  - 200g coconut cream

directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 220°C/200°C fan/gas 7. Pierce the sweet potatoes with a fork, place on a baking tray and bake for about 40 mins, until soft and cooked through.
  - Meanwhile, in a large pan over a high heat, fry the coriander stalks in the olive oil for 1 min. Add the chipotle spice paste and stir.
  - Stir in the beans with 150ml water; season well. Cook for 15-20 mins, until rich and thickened. Add a little extra spice paste to taste, if needed, then stir in the coconut cream and warm through for a couple of mins.
  - Slice open the potatoes, fill each with a generous spoonful of the bean mixture and scatter with coriander leaves. Keep leftover beans covered in the fridge for up to 3 days.
