ingredients:
  - 2 tbsp nutritional yeast
  - 1 tbsp dried basil
  - 1½ tsp onion powder
  - 1 tsp garlic powder
  - ½ tsp black pepper
  - ½ cup walnuts
  - 1¼ cup vital wheat gluten
  - 1 cup cooked lentils
  - ⅓ cup sun-dried tomatoes (in oil)
  - 2 tbsp soy sauce
  - 6 tbsp water

directions:
  - Add all the dry ingredients (except the seitan) to a food processor and pulse until you reach a crumb.
  - Add everything else and kneed to a smooth dough by hand or in a mixer.
  - Pinch off some of the dough and roll into a vegan meatball about the size of a golf ball and set aside on a plate or dish. Repeat until all the dough is used up and you have made about 20 meatballs.
  - Steam the balls for 25 minutes, gently turning them halfway through. They will expand a bit when they steam. Once the steaming is done, you can either prepare them right away, or allow them to cool completely and store in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to 5 days, or freeze for later.
  - Pan fry them to give them some colour and serve with your favourite sauce.
