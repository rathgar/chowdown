# Fermentation Process

## First Fermentation

Pour 500ml of non-chlorinated water/coconut water per 20g of water kefir grains into your jar. Add one tablespoon of sugar (15g) per 20g of water kefir grains and stir, so the sugar begins to dissolve. You can use warm water/coconut water if you wish, however, we have never found any real need for this. Never use boiling/hot water. This will harm the water kefir grains. Always allow any water to cool back down to room temperature (20c) if needed before continuing.

Never leave any fermenting product in direct sunlight. This can lead to unwanted bacteria and pathogens forming.

Add your water kefir grains to the mixture. Cover the jar and leave it at room temperature (20c) out of direct sunlight for 48 hours. During colder times when the optimum temperature is not being met, you may need to leave the grains longer (72-96 hours) to ferment. We always recommended leaving the grains in the warmest possible location. If this is not possible, it may be worth considering investing in a heat mat or similar device.

At this stage, the water kefir should still taste sweet. This is normal. The sugar left is required to carry out good carbonation (see the second fermentation below).

Strain the water kefir grains out of the mixture using your plastic strainer, decanting the liquid into your measuring jug. This strained liquid is your drinkable water kefir. You can drink this right away if you wish. However, we would advise that you carry out the second fermentation stage on this liquid. Not only will it allow for carbonation (which makes it taste great), it will also increase the bacteria count and reduce the sugar levels further.

If you do not wish to carbonate your water kefir or carry out a second fermentation. We would recommend leaving the strained liquid unsealed at room temperature for a further 3-5 days to increase the bacteria count and reduce sugar levels further.

### What to do with the grains now

Place the water kefir grains back into your fermentation jar and repeat the process to make a fresh batch of water kefir. Usually, you would do this right away, while you are waiting for the second fermentation process on the batch made previously to finish. This is a continuous brewing cycle.

If you wish to take a break from this cycle, place the grains into the fresh sugar water and place them in the fridge. They can rest in the fridge for up to 3 weeks. Please be aware that an activation process is usually required to revive the somewhat dormant grains from the fridge.

You grains will grow quite quickly. During the warm summer months, you may find they double in weight every 3-5 days. During the winter, they will usually double in size every 2 weeks.

When brewing water kefir, a good rule of thumb is to use 1 tablespoon of sugar per 20g of water kefir. With a maximum of 40g of water kefir per litre. Too much sugar or too many water kefir grains can lead to over fermentation and more alcohol content. Please be aware that if you are using coconut water, this will contain its natural sugars. This means coconut water kefir will always be sweeter than standard water kefir.

This ratio is a guideline, not an exact science. Trial and error can be a big part of the fermentation process.

## Second Fermentation

It is now time to flavour your strained water kefir. At this point, your water kefir should still taste sweet. This is expected and does not mean your fermentation has failed. It is important for some sugar to remain for the carbonation process to work.

You can use many different things to flavour water kefir. Chopped fruit (cut small so it can be added to the bottles), fruit juice and herbal tea are some of the most common.

### The Carbonation Process

Using your plastic funnel, pour the flavoured liquid into your glass bottles and then seal them by closing the lids The bottles need to be 100% airtight. In the summer leave the bottles for 3-5 days until carbonated. During the winter it can take up to 10 days. Check the bottles every 3 days for signs of carbonation by gently opening the lids to listen for gas. Water kefir can get very fizzy in the summer. Always ensure you use bottles designed to hold carbonated drinks to avoid the risk of explosions.

For fizzy water kefir, it is important to use something fully airtight in the second fermentation process. If you are not getting much fizz, this usually means air is escaping from your container. It could also mean that the bacteria have already used all the sugar in your mixture. A small amount of sugar needs to be present to allow gases to be produced by the fermentation process. Usually, if youâ€™re adding fruit, this will contain the additional sugar required anyway.

The water kefir is now ready to drink. Place your bottles in the fridge to cool. Be very careful when opening the bottles. Water kefir produces a very fizzy beverage.

Water kefir will keep in the fridge for around 30 days unopened. Once opened, it is best consumed within 3 days.
