ingredients:
  - 1 tsp ground cumin
  - 1 tsp ground coriander
  - ½ tsp ground turmeric
  - 1 large aubergine
  - 2 tbsp tomato purée
  - ½ green chilli , finely chopped
  - 1cm piece ginger , peeled and finely chopped
  - 2 tsp caster sugar
  - ½-1 tbsp rapeseed oil
  - 3 spring onions , chopped
  - ½ bunch of coriander , shredded
  - cooked rice , natural yogurt or vegan alternative, roti and lime wedges, to serve

directions:
  - Mix the dry spices and 1 tsp salt together in a bowl and set aside.
  - Slice the aubergine into 1cm rounds, then score both sides of each round with the tip of a sharp knife. Rub with the spice mix until well coated (you should use all of the mix), then transfer to a board. Put 150ml water in the empty spice bowl with the tomato purée, chilli, ginger and sugar. Set aside.
  - Heat the oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat and arrange the aubergine in the pan, overlapping the rounds if needed. Fry for 5 mins on each side, or until golden. Add the liquid mix from the bowl, bring to a simmer, cover and cook for 15-20 mins, turning the aubergine occasionally until it’s cooked through. If it seems dry, you may need to add up to 100ml more water to make it saucier. Season.
  - Scatter over the spring onions and coriander, and serve with rice, yogurt, roti and lime wedges for squeezing over.
