ingredients:
  - 4 cloves of garlic
  - 1 tsp smoked paprika
  - ½ a bunch of fresh thyme
  - olive oil
  - 1 lemon
  - 1 large cauliflower, with outer leaves (1kg)
  - 4 tbsp dry sherry
  - 400g tin of quality plum tomatoes
  - 40g flaked almonds
  - ½ bunch of fresh flat-leaf parsley
  - extra virgin olive oil

directions:
  - Preheat the oven to 180ºC
  - Peel the garlic, then add to a pestle and mortar with the paprika and half the thyme leaves. Bash well to a rough paste, then muddle in 2 tablespoons of olive oil and season.
  - Zest the lemon into a separate bowl and set aside.
  - Trim the outer cauliflower leaves. Trim away and discard the stalk so the cauliflower can sit flat, then cut a cross into the base.
  - Rub the paprika paste all over the cauliflower, then place in a medium casserole pan. Drizzle over the sherry and squeeze the lemon juice on top.
  - Cover and pop in the hot oven for around 1 hour 20 minutes, or until tender, removing the lid for the final 20 minutes.
  - Remove the pan from the oven, then pour in the tomatoes, tearing or slicing them up into chunks. Sprinkle over the lemon zest and pick over the remaining thyme leaves.
  - Return the pan to the oven for a further 10 minutes, or until the cauliflower is golden.
  - Meanwhile, toast the almonds in a dry frying pan over a medium-low heat until golden, then leave to cool.
  - Once ready, take the pan out of the oven. Scrunch over the toasted almonds, then pick, roughly chop and scatter the parsley leaves on top.
  - Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil, then carve up and serve with pilaf rice and steamed greens, or as part of a bigger spread.
